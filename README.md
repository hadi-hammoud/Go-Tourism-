# Go Tourism: A Local Tourism Platform in Lebanon

## Overview

**Go** is an AI-powered web and mobile application designed to revitalize and simplify tourism in Lebanon by offering personalized travel experiences. The platform helps both local and foreign travelers discover Lebanon's cultural, historical, and natural gems while supporting local businesses and encouraging sustainable tourism.

Developed as part of our senior project at the **Faculty of Science, Department of Mathematics and Computer Science**, Go is more than a tourism app—it’s a travel companion that promotes cultural discovery, economic empowerment, and user-centered exploration.
